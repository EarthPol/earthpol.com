# Nomad Guide

## Overview
Nomads are independent players who choose to live without joining a town. This playstyle offers freedom and flexibility but comes with its own unique challenges. Whether you're a new player exploring your options or a veteran seeking a fresh experience, becoming a nomad can be a rewarding alternative.

## Gameplay
As a nomad, you rely on your own skills and wits to survive. You won't have access to town protections or spawns, so careful planning and mobility are key. Nomads often set up temporary camps, travel between areas for trade, or support larger factions through mercenary work, logistics, or resource gathering.

### Movement
Mobility is the heart of nomadic life. Without a permanent base, nomads constantly move through the world, adapting to the environment and surviving off the land. This includes hunting animals for food, harvesting wild crops, mining valuable resources, and finding natural shelters. Staying light and mobile is necessary and Nomads should always be ready to relocate. This roaming lifestyle allows nomads to remain elusive, self-sufficient, and unpredictable in a world where towns often dominate the map.

### Towny Camps
Included in your starter kit is a campfire, which can be used to create a Towny Camp. A Towny Camp is a temporary, one-chunk claimed area where the owner can store items that are protected from PvP and griefing. This area is accessible only to the owner, providing temporary safety and privacy for new players. Towny Camps only exist for 48 hours but deactivated camps can be re-lit to reset their time. Additionally, Towny Camps have a 24-hour cooldown before a new one can be placed.

**Creating a Towny Camp**  
When you place your campfire, you will be prompted with the following question:  
_"Would you like to make a Towny Camp?"_  
To create a Towny Camp, either click the `/confirm` button or type `/confirm` in chat.

### Animal Companions
Like any other player, Nomads can tame animals such as horses, dogs, and other companions. You can bring them along your journey by using leads. This adds both utility and flavor to your travelsâ€”horses provide faster transportation, while pets can assist in combat or provide company on the road.
