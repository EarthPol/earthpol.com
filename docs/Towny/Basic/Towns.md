# Town Guide

## Overview

A **town** is a player-created settlement in Towny that offers a more permanent solution for land claiming than a Towny Camp. While Towny Camps are temporary and expire after a set period, towns do not have an expiration time. However, they will disband if the town fails to pay its upkeep. Once established, a town can grow over time, with the mayor (and any co-mayors/assistants) managing the town's territory, permissions, and overall governance. This provides a more structured and permanent place for players to build and interact.

Towns come with many benefits, including protection from PvP and griefing within the claimed area. This makes them ideal for players who want to build and collaborate in a secure, controlled environment. Players can set up various districts, claim plots of land for specific purposes (like farms, shops, or homes), and manage who can access different parts of their town. It is also possible to create town-based economies with the addition of shops and trade systems.

The success of a town relies on both management and community involvement. Regular activity, cooperation, and effective use of the town’s resources are key to maintaining and growing the settlement.

## Joining a Town

There are a couple of ways to join a town. If you wish to join a town that’s accepting new members, you can either:
- Request an invitation: Many towns are not open to all players, meaning you will need to request an invitation from the town’s mayor or co-mayor.
- Join an open town: If the town is open for new residents, you can join by typing `/t join town`.

Once invited, you can accept the invitation by typing /accept in chat or simply clicking the prompt that appears in the chat window. After joining, you’ll be able to claim plots, use town amenities, and participate in town governance, depending on the permissions set by the town's leadership.
Creating a Town

## Creating a Town

To create your own town, you will need 512 gold and an unclaimed area where you can establish your town's boundaries. You can then issue the command `/t new [Town Name]`, replacing `[Town Name]` with your desired town name. It’s important to ensure that your town name adheres to the server’s naming rules.

After issuing the command, you will be asked to confirm the creation of the town. You can do so by typing `/confirm` in chat or clicking the confirmation button that appears. Once your town is created, you’ll be the mayor and have full control over the town's land, governance, and permissions. From here, you can start managing the town, inviting new members, and claiming land to grow your settlement.

Once the town is established, you’ll be able to further expand by claiming more land using the `/t claim command`, setting up shops, building infrastructure, and even establishing town-based ranks or roles. It’s important to note that creating a town also requires paying regular upkeep to maintain its status, so keeping the town’s economy active is essential for long-term success.

## Growing Your Town

Growing your town in Towny comes down to being active, organized, and making it a place people actually want to live in. One of the best ways to bring in new residents is by offering plots, either for free or at a low cost so new people have a reason to join and settle down, knowing their items are safe from wild. When players feel like they have a space of their own, they’re much more likely to stick around.

To invite a new player to your town, preform the `/t add [playername]` or `/t invite [player]` commands, a list of players who are not part of a town will show at the bottom of your screen. Additionally, it never hurts to reach out to new players and ask if they need a town.

It is best to give players an empty plot for them to create their own home within the town. If you are worried about aesthetics, ask if they would like their house to be built for them or if they would like to build in the style of your town.

Activity is another big factor. When the mayor, comayors, and assistants are online regularly and working on new builds or infrastructure like roads, farms, shops, or public areas, it helps your town feel alive and gives people something to contribute to. A well-built town naturally draws more attention and makes it easier to grow.

It's also a good idea to have shops in your town where residents can trade with each other. Having a shop at your /t spawn where players can buy and sell goods helps you get the resources you need without grinding for them while also giving players a chance to make money and build wealth.

Having a town Discord server helps a lot too. It gives residents a place to chat, ask questions, get updates, and suggest ideas. The more connected your community is, the more likely people are to stay and invite their friends.

At the end of the day, if your town is organized, active, welcoming, and has many activities going on, people will want to join and help it grow. If you get enough people, you can create mutliple towns or even an entire nation!
