# Nation Guide

## Overview

A **nation** is a player-created political entity in Towny that operates on a larger scale than individual towns. Nations allow for the unification of multiple towns under a single banner, enabling cooperation, diplomacy, and mutual defense between settlements. Unlike towns, nations are not limited by a specific area and can expand across vast regions of the map, providing more opportunities for collaboration, trade, and governance. Nations provide protection against PvP and griefing within the areas controlled by their towns, offering a secure and organized environment for players to build and collaborate on a larger scale.

Nations also allow for the establishment of alliances, the declaration of war, and the management of multiple towns, making them ideal for players who wish to take on leadership roles or participate in large-scale collaborative projects. A well-managed nation can support a thriving economy, develop vast infrastructure, and form strong diplomatic ties with other nations.

The success of a nation relies on the coordination between its towns, the leadership of the nation’s ruler(s), and the active involvement of its citizens. Effective communication and cooperation between towns is essential to ensure a nation’s prosperity and growth.

## Joining a Nation

There are a few ways to join a nation. If you wish to become part of an existing nation, you can either:

- Request an invitation: Many nations are selective about which towns they allow to join. You can contact the nation's leader or a high-ranking official to request an invitation.
- Join an open nation: If the nation is open to towns, you can join directly by typing /n join [nation].

Once invited, you can accept the invitation by typing /accept or clicking the prompt that appears in chat. After joining, you’ll become a part of the nation and be able to enjoy its benefits, such as protection, access to nation-wide resources, and participation in the nation’s governance.

## Creating a Nation

To create your own nation, you will need 1000 gold and at least one town under your control. Once you meet the requirements, you can issue the command /n new [Nation Name], replacing [Nation Name] with your desired nation name. Make sure to choose a name that complies with the server’s naming rules.

After issuing the command, you’ll be asked to confirm the creation of the nation. You can confirm by typing /confirm in chat or clicking the confirmation button that appears. Once your nation is created, you’ll become the ruler of that nation, and you will have full control over the nation’s territories, alliances, and diplomatic relations. From here, you can invite more towns, expand your borders, and establish your nation’s economy and infrastructure.

Once the nation is established, you can further expand by adding new towns to your nation, forming alliances with other nations, and claiming land. You’ll also need to manage your nation’s resources, diplomacy, and defense to ensure its long-term success. Regular upkeep is required to maintain the nation’s status, so managing your nation's economy is crucial.

## Growing Your Nation

Growing a nation in Towny is about fostering cooperation, expanding your territory, and making your nation an attractive place for towns to join. One of the most effective ways to grow your nation is by inviting towns to join, either by directly contacting their leaders or advertising your nation’s benefits. If you already control multiple towns, you can extend invitations to other towns to join your nation and contribute to its growth.

To invite a new town to your nation, perform the `/n add [townname]` or `/n invite [townname] commands, and a list of available towns will be displayed. Don’t hesitate to reach out to towns that may be looking for a nation.

It’s best to have a clear vision for your nation’s values and goals, so when inviting towns, you can ensure they align with your nation’s principles. Having a unified vision will keep your nation organized and ensure its long-term success.

Regular activity and communication among nation members are key to growing and maintaining a strong nation. As the nation leader, your presence and involvement will encourage others to stay active and contribute. Regularly working on nation-wide projects such as infrastructure, defense systems, and trade routes will keep your nation active and attract new towns.

A strong economy is essential for growing your nation. Having a trade network between your towns can increase the resources available for expansion. A centralized nation shop or trade system can also benefit the economy by providing goods and services to residents of all towns in your nation.

Communication is critical for a successful nation, so having a nation Discord server can help keep everyone connected. A Discord server allows members to chat, share ideas, ask questions, and stay updated on important events. It also helps foster a sense of community, which is crucial to the long-term success of your nation.

At the end of the day, if your nation is well-organized, active, and provides meaningful benefits to its towns, other players will want to join, and your nation will grow. By creating a cohesive, dynamic nation, you can unite players under a common cause, achieve great things, and even challenge other nations for dominance in the world!
