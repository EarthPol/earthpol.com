## Basic Overview

### üèïÔ∏è Towny Camps

Included in your starter kit is a campfire, which can be used to create a Towny Camp. A Towny Camp is a temporary, one-chunk claimed area where the owner can store items that are protected from PvP and griefing. This area is accessible only to the owner, providing temporary safety and privacy for new players. Towny Camps only exist for 48 hours but de-activated camps can be re-lit to reset their time. Additionally, Towny Camps have a 24 hour cooldown before a new one can be placed. 

**Creating a Towny Camp**

When you place your campfire, you will be prompted with the following question: "Would you like to make a Towny Camp?" To create a Towny Camp, either click the /confirm button or type `/confirm` in chat.

### üèôÔ∏è Towns

A town is a player-created settlement that provides more permanent land claims than a Towny Camp. Towns do not expire in a specific timeframe but do disband if the town is unable to pay its upkeep. Once created, towns can expand over time, with the mayor (and any comayors/assistants) having control over the town‚Äôs territory, including who can join, manage, and access it. Towns also offer protection from PvP and griefing within their claimed areas, making them ideal for players who want to build and collaborate in a secure environment. 

**Joining a Town**

To join a town, you may either request invitation or join an open town. Once invited, type `/accept` or click the prompt in chat. You can join open towns via `/t join <town>`.

**Creating a Town**

To create a town, you will need 512 gold and an unclaimed area. Simply issue the command `/t new [Town Name]`, replacing `[Town Name]` with the name of your town. Make sure to verify that your town's name is appropriate and complies with our rules. You can then confirm the creation by either clicking the /confirm button or typing `/confirm` in chat.

**Basic Town-Related Commands**
* `/t spawn` teleports you to town's spawn.
* `/t invite <player>` invites a player to your town.
* `/t leave` lets you leave town. It must not be owned by you.

### üèõÔ∏è Nations

A nation is a larger political entity composed of multiple towns brought together under a unified government. Nations cost 5,000 gold to create, making them a long-term goal for any growing town. In addition to the benefits of a town, nations include additional benefits such as the ability to engage in diplomacy, form alliances, and declare wars. By joining a nation, towns gain additional protection, resources, and a stronger voice in the broader political landscape of EarthPol.
