# Server Overview

### Welcome to EarthPol!

EarthPol is a geopolitical Minecraft server where players can simulate diplomacy, economics, and trade on a 1:326 scale map of Earth. Whether you wish to lead a powerful nation, engage in global trade, or strategically wage war, EarthPol provides a dynamic sandbox for you to shape the course of history. It is our goal for players to think like diplomats to make a sucessful and efficient global order.

For nearly five years, EarthPol has continued to set the standard for immersive and innovative gameplay. Our team of developers have built upon sucessful features and mechanics that provide a unique experience for every player.

#### Key Features

-**Player-Drived World:** EarthPol has no defined or predetermined storyline; its history is shaped entirely by its players. While we may simulate events, the responses and actions of players are individually unique.

-**Map:** Our custom Earth map is handcrafted, using real-world data to simulate ore generation while maintaining vanilla underground features like caves, mineshafts, and ancient cities. At 1:326 scale, 
there is a significant level of detail that makes geopolitics and geography important factors in nation-building and overall strategy. 

-**Innovation:** Thanks to the implementation of Folia, our server is efficiently divided into separate regions, which significantly reduces lag. Whether you're building, exploring, or engaging in server activities, the seamless experience is guaranteed without any disruptions to your enjoyment.

-**Hardware:** Using the latest technology on the market, our server ensures stability and peak performance. Our **hourly backup system** guarantees that no significant progress is lost in the event of an unexpected catastrophe, preserving the integrity of the EarthPol world. Additionally, the implementation of Folia has efficiently divded our server into seperate regions, significanly reducing lag.
