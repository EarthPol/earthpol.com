# Server Overview

### Welcome to EarthPol!

EarthPol is a geopolitical Minecraft server where players can simulate diplomacy, economics, and trade on a 1:326 scale map of Earth. Whether you wish to lead a powerful nation, engage in global trade, or strategically wage war, EarthPol provides a dynamic sandbox for you to shape the course of history. It is our goal for players to think like diplomats to make a sucessful and efficient global order.

For nearly five years, EarthPol has continued to set the standard for immersive and innovative gameplay. Our team of developers have built upon sucessful features and mechanics that provide a unique experience for every player.

#### Key Features:

* **Player-Drived World:** EarthPol has no defined or predetermined storyline; its history is shaped entirely by its players. While we may simulate events, the responses and actions of players are individually unique.

* **Map:** Our custom Earth map is handcrafted, using real-world data to simulate ore generation while maintaining vanilla underground features like caves, mineshafts, and ancient cities. At **1:326 scale**, there is a significant level of detail that makes geopolitics and geography important factors in nation-building and overall strategy. 

* **Innovation:** Thanks to the implementation of **Folia**, our server is efficiently divided into separate regions, which significantly reduces lag. Whether you're building, exploring, or engaging in server activities, the seamless experience is guaranteed without any disruptions to your enjoyment.

* **Hardware:** Using the latest technology on the market, our server ensures stability and peak performance. Our **hourly backup system** guarantees that no significant progress is lost in the event of an unexpected catastrophe, preserving the integrity of the EarthPol world.

### Why EarthPol?

EarthPol is truly unique because of its five years of history and development, giving us a proven track record of improvement. While previous versions of the server faced their own challenges, our latest unified effort has created a more stable, cohesive experience for everyone. More importantly, our game-design philosophy is centered around absolute freedom for our players and giving them the tools to tell their own story in a world where their decisions are consequential.

Furthermore, our approach sets us apart from other geopolitical servers. The EarthPol Development Team has expertise in both computer science and international relations, providing a more well-rounded and balanced experience rather than just focusing solely on server development. In addition, our staff is fully dedicated to maintaining and growing the community, always listening to player feedback and prioritizing their concerns with transparency and care.

#### Notable Plugins

To support our philosophy of player-driven gameplay, we’ve carefully selected a set of plugins that enhance interaction, strategy, and creativity within the game:

* **Towny:** With Towny, players can create their own towns and nations, form alliances, and manage territories. EarthPol’s Towny configuration is specifically tailored to reflect the geography of our custom Earth map, where scarcity and resource management are significant factors in nation-building.
* **SiegeWar:** SiegeWar allows players to engage in large-scale battles to capture cities and defend their territories. This tactical element of gameplay allows for alternative decisions while engaging in diplomacy.
* **TradeWar:** A unique plugin created by our developers, TradeWar enables players to simulate trade conflicts within the Towny framework. Key features, such as tariffs, embargoes, and sanctions, let players wage economic battles, providing an alternative to direct combat.
* **QuickShop:** To simulate a real-world economy, QuickShop offers an accessible and interactive way for players to set up shops, buy and sell items, and create a dynamic global market. This plugin encourages trade and entrepreneurship, making the in-game economy a vital part of players' choices.
