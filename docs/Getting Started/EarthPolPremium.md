# EarthPol Premium

EarthPol Premium is our subscription-based service designed to give players exclusive in-game perks while supporting the long-term sustainability of our server. As EarthPol continues to grow, so do the costs of maintaining our infrastructure, plugins, and community resources. EarthPol Premium helps offset these costs while giving back to the players who support us.

For only $9.99/month, you can have access to the following EarthPol Premium perks:

- Premium-Only Discord Chat: Exclusive access to a Premium-only Discord chat, including sneak peeks at upcoming developments.
- EarthPol Rewind: Ability to connect to servers from V4 and V6 to view old builds.
- Change Nation Color: Nation leaders are able to change their nation color from the default blue.

Additionally, EarthPol Premium gives access to the following commands:

| Premium Feature                   | Description                                       |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `/craft`                  | Craft items anywhere without a crafting table.   |
| `/nick`                   | Customize your nickname with colors.             |
| `/hat`                    | Wear any item as a hat for fun personalization.  |
| `/echest`                 | Access your ender chest from anywhere.           |
| `/anvil`                  | Use an anvil anytime without needing the block.  |


Your subscription doesnâ€™t just come with perks, it helps make EarthPol better for everyone. The revenue generated from EarthPol Premium goes directly toward server hosting fees and plugin development.
