### Troubleshooting

If you have trouble joining the server, please make sure that:
- You are using Minecraft Java Edition. Bedrock Edition is currently **not** supported.
- Your account is a real Minecraft account purchased from minecraft.net.
- You have a stable network connection.

Still can't join? [Try to change DNS servers to 1.1.1.1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setup/windows/) (Cloudflare) or 8.8.8.8 (Google). We have noticed that some players using DNS servers provided by their ISP sometimes have difficulties joining the server.
