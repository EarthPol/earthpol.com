# TradeWar

## Overview

A unique plugin to EarthPol, TradeWar allows for nations to enact protectionist trade policies on foreign/hostile nations. Currently, there are three types of protectionist policies:
- Tariffs: 
- Sanctions: Can be issued against a town or player to prevent them from buying items at a shop within your nation. 
- Embargoes: Used exclusively for nations in order to prevent their members from buying items at any shop within your nation.
