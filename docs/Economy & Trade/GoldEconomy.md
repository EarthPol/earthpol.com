## Overview

In our economy, gold serves as the primary currency. It is essential for transactions, and players can earn, spend, and trade gold throughout the game. The system is designed to make gold the backbone of your in-game wealth and economy, ensuring a rich and immersive experience for all players.

## Earning Gold

There are several ways to obtain gold in the game, below are a few recommendations:

1. Mining – Gold can be mined from gold ores found in the world, which can then be smelted into ingots or blocks.
2. Voting – Participate in server voting to earn gold as a reward.
3. Selling Items – You can sell items to other players by using player shops (*See our guide on QuickShop*).
4. Events – Participate in various server events that offer gold rewards as part of the prize pool.

## Converting and Using Gold

Once you’ve acquired gold, you have can add it to your balance by doing the following:

- /sell Hand: To convert gold ingots or blocks into your balance, simply use the `/sell hand` command while holding gold in your hand. This is an easy way to liquidate any excess gold you have into your account balance.

You are only able to add gold ingots or gold blocks to your balance, raw ore or ore blocks do not count.

To take gold out of your balance, do the following:

- Gold Exchange: Head over to `/warp GoldExchange`, where you can access the admin shop. This allows you to withdraw physical gold from your balance and use it for crafting.

Once gold has been added to your balance, you can use it to buy items from shops, create towns, or deposite funds into towns and nations.

## Building Wealth

Here are some effective strategies to help you earn gold for yourself or your town/nation:

- Creating a shop: Some items are in high demand and can fetch you more gold. Look for popular materials like diamonds, enchanted books, rare blocks, and ores to sell. Keep an eye on what other players are looking for and target those items for the best profits.

- Use Fortune for Mining: When mining, use a Fortune-enchanted pickaxe. This enchantment increases the drop rate of gold, which can significantly boost your gold intake.

- Join Our Discord: Join our Discord to stay updated on upcoming events. Many events provide large gold rewards, and being active in the community will help you discover opportunities to earn big.

- Participate in Events: Server events often feature gold as a reward. Keep an eye on event announcements for chances to earn gold in creative ways, such as competitions, challenges, and special activities.

- Trading with Other Players: If you're good at crafting or gathering resources, you can trade with other players for gold. Set up a shop or offer services like custom builds or mapart for a gold fee.

With these strategies, you can quickly build up your wealth and take full advantage of the gold-based economy!
