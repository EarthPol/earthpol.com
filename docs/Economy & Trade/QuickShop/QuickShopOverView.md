# QuickShop Guide

## Overview

Whether you're looking to make purchases or set up your own shop, this guide provides everything you need to navigate the QuickShop system on EarthPol. 

## For Customers 

### Buying from a Shop
Buying an item from a shop is simple. First, left-click anywhere on the shop chest you want to buy from, then type the amount you wish to purchase in chat. If you have enough money, the item will be removed from the chest and automatically placed in your inventory.

Some shops may be set up to buy items rather than sell them. If you have the item they’re looking for, simply interact with the chest the same way (left-click the chest and enter the quantity in chat). The shop will take the item from your inventory and pay you in gold based on the price displayed on the chest.

To review, here is a step-by-step guide to buying an item:

1. Left click anywhere on the shop chest.
2. Input the amount you wish to buy.

### Avoiding Scams

While EarthPol does allow scamming, it’s entirely possible to avoid getting tricked. When you left-click on the chest, a QuickShop GUI will appear in chat. Click on the `Item Preview` button to see the item inside the chest and confirm that the purchase is legitimate.

:::warning

As per 1.1, scamming is permitted, except for "town leaders and trusted positions (mayors, co-mayors, assistants, builders) who must not steal from town residents."

## For Shop Owners

### Creating a Shop

To create a shop, start by placing a chest in the location where you want your shop to be. This chest will serve as the physical point of sale for other players. Once the chest is placed, left-click it while holding the item you want to sell. This action will prompt you to enter the selling price in chat. After setting the price, open the chest and place the item(s) inside. These are the items that will be available for purchase by other players. Once everything is set, the shop will be active and ready for business. To restock, just open the chest and place the same item(s) back inside.

To review, below is a step-by-step guide to creating a shop:

1. Place a chest.
2. Left-click the chest with the item you want to sell.
3. Enter the selling price in chat.
4. Place the item(s) into the chest.

If you instead wish to buy items from players rather than sell to players, simply open the QuickShop GUI by left-clicking and press the `[Change]` button next to "Shop Mode: Selling." This will convert the chest into a "buying" chests where players can sell you items and receive money from your gold balance.

If you wish to change the price of the item(s) you are selling/buying, open the QuickShop GUI by left-click and press the `[Change]` button next to "Price:", this will allow you to input a new buy/sell price. 

### Removing a Shop

To remove a shop, simply left-click to open the QuickShop GUI. At the bottom of the menu, you’ll see a red button labeled `[Remove Shop]`. Click this button once, and then confirm the removal by clicking again within 5 seconds. Once confirmed, the shop will be removed and you’re free to safely break the chest without any issues.

Step-by-Step Guide to Removing a Shop:

1. Left-click the chest to open the QuickShop GUI.
2. Click the red `[Remove Shop]` button at the bottom of the menu.
3. Confirm the removal by clicking again within 5 seconds.

## Alternative Use

### Chest Vaults

Chest shops can only be accessed by their owner. As a result, players may choose to use chest shops as secure storage by setting an extremely high price, effectively preventing other players from purchasing the items inside. While this is allowed, we also encourage players to consider using their own individual plots as an alternative method for safely storing personal items.
