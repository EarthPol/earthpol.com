# EarthPol Website  

This is the official website for **EarthPol**, built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static site generator.  

## ðŸš€ Getting Started  

### 1. Clone the Repository  
First, clone the repository to your local machine:  

```
git clone https://github.com/EarthPol/earthpol.com.git
cd earthpol.com
```

## ðŸ’» Local Development  

To start the Docusaurus development server:  
```
npm run start
```

This will launch a local server at **http://localhost:3000/**, automatically opening a browser window. Most changes will be reflected live without restarting the server.  

## ðŸ”§ Building the Website  

To generate the static files:  

```
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` directory containing the static files, which can be hosted using any static file hosting service.  

## ðŸ“Œ Additional Notes  
- If you encounter issues with dependencies, try running `npm cache clean --force` and reinstalling (`npm install`).  
- For more details, check out the [Docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs).
